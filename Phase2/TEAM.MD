## Team Contract:

        The work will be divided equally among all team members.

        I will finish my work on time and notify the group if anything prevents me from doing so.  
        I will attend every team meeting and actively participate.  
        I will work to the best of my ability and ask for help if I do not understand a concept or code.

## Individual/Group Work:

        Work will be done in a group when possible and is up to each member to decide if they want to work individually or in pairs.

## Note Taking:

        The designated note taker will alternate between everyone in the group.
